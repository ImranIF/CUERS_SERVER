## Overview
CUERS is a web-based digital exam remuneration system with a centralized database, containing all information about the evaluators (teachers) and exam-committee members of each department of University of Chittagong. In an effort to generate the remuneration forms and subsequently the bills of each evaluator correctly, the system significantly reduces the workload and time needed by digitizing the whole process.

### Dynamically Modifying Info in Table
After loging in, you can tap on the Manage evaluators option on the sidebar, which opens a new page where a table will be displayed that represents information of currently available evaluators in the system. Any information could be modified by tapping on any cell on the table. Some information allows you to select from a dropdown, while others allow you to write them directly on the cell. Also, any record could be deleted by tapping the delete button.

As the system does input authentication, it forbids any invalid data on the cell. If the user inputs any, the system will show an error message.
